Develop a Program in C for the following operationson Singly Circular Linked List (SCLL) with header nodes
a. Represent and Evaluate a Polynomial P(x,y,z) = 6x2y2z-4yz5+3x3yz+2xy5z-2xyz3
b. Find the sum of two polynomials POLY1(x,y,z) and POLY2(x,y,z) and store the result in POLYSUM(x,y,z)
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations
